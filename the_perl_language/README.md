# Perl

## About

It's about using Perl as the main language when working as a Software Engineer or DevOps Engineer.

Software engineers create software and systems for computers. They employ math, science, engineering, and design techniques to build these systems. Additionally, they must be able to test and evaluate their own systems of software built by other engineers.

Software engineers should have strong analytical and problem-solving skills. A software engineer has a thirst for new technologies, as well for maintaining strong communication and interpersonal skills. Software engineers must be highly motivated and experienced in various programming languages. 

Being a Perl Monger could be a significant vantage for Developers or System Administrators as Perl can be found in almost all machines and systems. Furthermore, because of the expresivity power of Perl, good software developers can use or quicly create their own tools that facilitate or automate boring tasks for the system's development and testing.

Perl, despite being less widely used lately in the face of new fashion languages such as Python, Ruby and Go, remains in high demand, still being one of the most respected languages in computer history.

Perl (Acronim for Practical Extraction and Report Language), written originaly by Larry Wall, is a general-purpose programming language available in the main platforms, like Linux, Unix, MacOS and Windows, using the main characteristics Perl was originally developed for text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including system administration, web development, network programming, GUI development, and more.

The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) but also beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). Its major features are that it's easy to use, supports both procedural and object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in support for text processing, and has one of the world's most impressive collections of third-party modules.

## Theory Foundation

The volume *"The Perl Language"* is about: 

> Language Foundations
> Perl concepts 
> Best practices

The volume *"The Perl Engineer"* covers the various methods 
and procedures mostly used for creating and developing systems.

These two volumes cover the theory and the basic concepts, the
language correctness and the best practices for making and 
maintaining great software.

## Learn by Practice

The volume *"Perl Workbook"* is about the workflow of a DevOps using 
*Perl* as the main language.

> Create
> Automate
> Deploy

The volume *"Problems Solving with Perl"* presents exercises one
could find in interviews and hiring tests. 

> Problem
> Explanation
