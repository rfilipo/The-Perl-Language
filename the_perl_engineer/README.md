# Perl for Software Engineers

Software engineers create software and systems for computers. They employ math, science, engineering, and design techniques to build these systems. Additionally, they must be able to test and evaluate their own systems of software built by other engineers.

Software engineers should have strong analytical and problem-solving skills. A software engineer has a thirst for new technologies, as well for maintaining strong communication and interpersonal skills. Software engineers must be highly motivated and experienced in various programming languages. 

Being a Perl Monger could be a significant vantage for Developers or System Administrators as Perl can be found in almost all machines and systems. Furthermore, because of the expresivity power of Perl, good software developers can use or quicly create their own tools that facilitate or automate boring tasks for the system's development and testing.
