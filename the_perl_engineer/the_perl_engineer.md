# The Perl Engineer

Software engineers create software and systems for computers. They employ math, science, engineering, and design techniques to build these systems. Additionally, they must be able to test and evaluate their own systems of software built by other engineers.

Software engineers should have strong analytical and problem-solving skills. A software engineer usually loves new technologies, his job depends on maintaining strong communication and having interpersonal skills. Software engineers must be highly motivated and experienced in various programming languages. 

Being a Perl Monger could be a significant vantage for Developers and System Administrators as Perl can be found in almost all machines and systems, can be mixed with a sort of different languages and runs very efficiently. Furthermore, because of the expresivity power of Perl, good software developers can use or quicly create their own tools that facilitate or automate boring tasks for the system's development and testing.

This book focuses on practical improvements to the Engineer skills that will make the difference. The topics in each lesson will explain how each skill should be improved using Perl tools and the comunity to find the best solution to a particular problem.

## Skills

1. Multitasking

As a software engineer, you will be required to manage multiple projects in a deadline-driven environment. Whether you work remotely as a freelancer or as a full-time employee in an office, you’ll need to manage multiple projects at once, each with their own urgent timeline. A successful software engineer will be able to prioritize, triage, and manage all of the various milestones of all the various projects on their plate at a given time.

Along with managing timelines, a software engineer will need to be able to thrive in an environment where deadlines occur regularly. You’ll have to manage other people’s priorities and balance them with your own, along with the needs of your other clients or projects.

- Organization
- Prioritization
- Deadlines
- Managing Expectations

2. Teamwork

Building software systems is generally a solitary endeavor, but a software engineer must still be able to communicate regularly with other people and teams. As an engineer, you should be able to articulate project needs, as well as be able to discuss any challenges or problems that arise. Software engineers will routinely work with a number of other teams and departments at once, while also managing a team of their own.

You may be required to work with people whose ideas and philosophies you don’t agree with. Other times, misunderstandings arise and can threaten you and your team’s deadline. A successful engineer should be comfortable working closely with others, compromising and innovating as needed.

- Collaboration
- Compromising
- Active Listening
- Conflict Resolution
- Oral Communication
- Written Communication
- Attention to Detail

There are certain practices and standards in the industry that a successful software engineer must master. These include the basics, like utilizing version control systems so that you don’t lose old work, or employing a robust and thorough testing protocol. They also include more complex details such as analyzing and maintaining older code, or developing strategic methodologies upon which you build a coding framework.

- Analytical Skills
- Troubleshooting
- Technical Documentation
- Formulas
- Data Analytics
- Creativity
- Critical Thinking

3. Computer Coding Languages
Many software engineers are fluent in one (or two) coding languages, and this becomes their primary area of expertise. While this is typical, the best engineers are familiar with all of the relevant coding languages on a basic level. An employer may not expect you to be fluent in all the coding languages of the day, but you will be more attractive to an employer if you’re able to learn languages with analogous qualities (structured versus functional, for example), or by knowing a bit about different types of languages.
